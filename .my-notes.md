# How-To

1. Make your edits, test locally with `hugo server -D` (it will make baseURL for icons = `localhost:1313`)
2. Ready to publish? build the website with `hugo build` (this will return back the baseURL to `muhammad-sulaiman.com`), commit & push
3. DONE.

## Notes:
1. hugo themes can be found at https://themes.gohugo.io/ and at https://hugoblox.com/
